# Guessing-Game
a fun little guessing game I created! The computer will pick a number between 1 and 100, and it is your job to guess until you solve the number! 
At the end, the computer will calculate the amount of guesses it took you to solve the number.

The computer uses a random engine to generate a random number. For this program, i chose it to generate a number between 1 and 100, but it can be anything!
I used a do-while loop to go through the different instances of a too big guess, a too small guess, etc. Each guess that's made, the variable 'g' increments, which will
represent the guesses used, and will generate at the end for the player. The do while loop lets the player play as many times as they want within the program,
without having to exit the program and restart it to play again.
